# :sparkles: Udacity Restaurant Reviews App Project :sparkles:
 This is a web-based application that shows resturants loactions along with their reviews. It is designed to be:
 * Mobile ready.
 * Full responsive.
 * Accessible.
 * Works offline.

## How to run the application?
1. Clone this repo in your device.
2. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around to see what the  experience looks like..
